# PylonCamQtDemo
This is a basic Pylon camera viewer demo using `Qt/C++`.

Builds on **MSVC** (Windwos),**aarch64**, and **x86** (Linux) machines. 

If you find the way to use Pylon with **Ming**, Please contact https://github.com/arkceajin

I referred this project https://github.com/nickdiego/qt-pylon.

But it gives an error after using the PylonViewer `Automatic Image Adjustment`:

> No grab result data is referenced. Cannot access NULL pointer.

Didn't find the way to fix it, so I create this.
